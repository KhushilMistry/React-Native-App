# React-Native-App

I had done a course on udemy.com : "Build your next app with React-Native and Express". This app is from there. It is Simple TODO App which is wriiten in Reactive Native and Node. For Database, we are using MongoDB.
For this app, you need to install Node to your machine. All other things can be installed with Node(npm packages).

First clone this Repository : 
```
git clone https://github.com/KhushilMistry/React-Native-App
```
Then move to the folder "React-Native-App" in your machine. 
Then move to the folder "Server_Code". Follow below instructions.
```
cd Server_code
npm install
nodemon index.js
```
Now Backend server whould be running on your machine. Now, follow below instruction to run your app : (This is for OSX operating system.)
```
cd ..
cd App
npm install
react-native link
react-native run-ios
```
App whould be running.
